# TRAFFIX: an AI management traffic solution

## Overview
* The objective is to alleviate pollution caused by vehicular traffic and idling at crossroads by implementing TRAFFIX, a comprehensive strategy. By employing TRAFFIX, the aim is to significantly lower pollution levels resulting from these activities while concurrently addressing other significant issues related to traffic congestion and environmental degradation.
## Key Features
1) Real-time Traffic Analysis:

Utilizes computer vision to analyze live video streams from intersection cameras.
Detects and tracks vehicles, pedestrians, and other relevant objects.

2) Dynamic Signal Control:

Adapts traffic signal timings in real-time based on current traffic conditions.
Optimizes signal control to reduce congestion and improve overall traffic flow.

3) Path-based Time Calculation:

Segments the intersection into paths and calculates the time spent by vehicles in each path.
Identifies maximum time durations, aiding in congestion analysis.

4) Machine Learning for Traffic Prediction:

Incorporates machine learning models to predict traffic patterns based on historical and real-time data.
Enhances the system's ability to adapt to changing traffic conditions.
