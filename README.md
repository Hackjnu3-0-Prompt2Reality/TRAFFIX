# AI-OPTIMIZED TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## Overview
* The Traffic Management System is a project aimed at optimizing traffic flow at intersections through the use of computer vision, real-time data processing, and machine learning. The system dynamically adjusts traffic signals, provides real-time insights into congestion, and enhances overall traffic management.
## Key Features
1) Real-time Traffic Analysis:

Utilizes computer vision to analyze live video streams from intersection cameras.
Detects and tracks vehicles, pedestrians, and other relevant objects.

2) Dynamic Signal Control:

Adapts traffic signal timings in real-time based on current traffic conditions.
Optimizes signal control to reduce congestion and improve overall traffic flow.

3) Path-based Time Calculation:

Segments the intersection into paths and calculates the time spent by vehicles in each path.
Identifies maximum time durations, aiding in congestion analysis.

4) Machine Learning for Traffic Prediction:

Incorporates machine learning models to predict traffic patterns based on historical and real-time data.
Enhances the system's ability to adapt to changing traffic conditions.
